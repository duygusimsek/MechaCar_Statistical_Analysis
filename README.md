# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview

A couple of data analyses were performed to solve the problems of the “MechaCar” that are blocking the manufacturing progress. 

In this analysis ;

* Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of the “MechaCar” prototypes. 

* Summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots were collected. 

* To determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population t-test was run. 

* A statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers was designed.

* A summary interpretation of the findings for each statistical analysis was written. 

* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. You’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings for each statistical analysis.
